# Overview of replication folder and how to replicate results

TODO: step by step instructions if not clear already.
Basically:
- Download dataset from Kersting et al
- Transform dataset to Geo2DR Gexf format using data_format_script_with_geo2dr.py
- Just use any of the scripts based on the method you want to replicate and adjust the script to use the dataset downloaded.
