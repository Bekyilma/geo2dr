Graph datasets, data formats and processing
===========================================

An important aspect of research is being able to develop methods and subsequently apply them onto the same datasets under the same conditions (as far as possible) to provide "fairer" comparisons. As such Geo2DR aims to provide tools to transform public datasets from popular repositories such as `TU Dortmund Graph Kernel Data <https://ls11-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/staff/morris/graphkerneldatasets>`_ into formats usable in Geo2DR modules (and elsewhere).
